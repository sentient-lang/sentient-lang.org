# Standard library

This section contains a reference of all methods and operators provided by
Sentient's standard library. These methods are defined globally and can be
called on any variable or expression. For more information about
[declaring variables](../specification/declaration) and how to
[call functions](../specification/function#calling-functions), please refer to
the **Language specification**.

This section also includes a note about [integer literals](literal) which are a
limitation of some functions in the standard library.
